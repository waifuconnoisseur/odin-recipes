        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An adaptation of curry with a flavor unlike that of any other asian nation. Japanese curry is characterized by a rich sauce that is much more toned down 
           spice wise than most curries. Japanese curry primarily served in three ways: over rice, with udon noodles and curry bread (a baked curry dumpling); It is 
           also sometimes served with Katsu. Japanese curry is an incredibly simple dish as well, requiring only five ingredients. With the addition of a dash of 
           worcestshire and soy sauce, it can be made even more savory, and becomes oven better to pair with katsu.
