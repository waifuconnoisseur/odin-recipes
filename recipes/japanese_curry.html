        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An adaptation of curry with a flavor unlike that of any other asian nation. Japanese curry is characterized by a sweet flavor, with a hint of spice and aromatics. 
           Japanese curry primarily served in three ways: over rice, with udon noodles and curry bread (a baked curry dumpling); It is also sometimes served with Katsu. Japanese
           curry roux can be acquired from the international food section of most walmarts. Medium-hot will tend to be a Tostito's mild salsa level of heat.
