        <h1>Tonkatsu with Katsu Sauce</h1>
        <img src="../images/tonkatsu.jpg" alt="Tonkatsu Meal" width="310" height="310">
        <p>Tonkatsu is Japanese for "pork cutlet" and as the name implies it involves a pork chop. Tonkatsu is cooked by breading a decently thick pork chop in 
           panko and deep frying until brown. This results in a juicy and cripy cut of delicious pork. One could also substitue the pork chop for chicken breast, or
           your preffered cut of beef. When one replaces the pork the name changes to Gyukatsu and Yakikatsu, for beed and chicken respectively.

        <p>Tonkatsu is often accompanied by what I think of as Japanese BBQ sauce, a thick condiment similar to British or Irish brown sauce. The actual ingredients 
           very from brand to brand, however it is worcestshire based and characterized by a sweet, tangy and rich taste reminiscent of A1. The recipe I will 
           include below is very simple and involves only a handful of ingredients, mixed and set aside for a half hour.
