        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Panang curry is a red thai curry, with a distinctive rich flavor. Panang is made with a combination of red curry, makrut lime leaves, coconut milk and other 
           assorted spices. In contrast to other Thai curries - which tend to be on the saucier side - panang tends to have a thick sauce, which is very rich. 
           The distinctive flavor is derived from the curry paste used, which is a doctored with a slightly different set of ingredients than normal red curry; 
           one of these additional ingredients is roasted peanuts.
