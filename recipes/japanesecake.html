    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese cheesecake also known as souffle-style cheesecake, is a variety of cheesecake known for it's light texture, and more muted sweetness than American
        style cheesecake. The texture is wobbly and airy when fresh, and a more chiffon-cake like texture once cool. The recipe was first created by Tomotaro Kuzuno 
        after trying a Kasekuchen cheesecake, during a trip to Berlin in the 1960s. It has less calories than a western cheesecake due to containing less creamcheese
        and sugar.
