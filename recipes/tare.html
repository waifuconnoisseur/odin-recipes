    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tare is a general term in Japan for dipping sauces often used for grilling, however it can also pair with sushi, nambemono and gyoza. Tare can also be
        added to the broth when making ramen, or used as a braising liquid for meat dishes. Tare is made with a combination of soy sauce, sake, mirin and various
        other additives and flavorings. Fairly simple to make tare simply requires you to mix ingredients, bring to a boil, redcuce to a simmer and reduce.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="direction">
        <li>400ml Sake</li>
        <li>400ml Mirin</li>
        <li>150ml Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>60ml White Sugar</li>
        <li>Chicken Bones (optional)</li>
        <li>Green Onion (optional)</li>
        <li>Garlic (optional)</li>

        <li>Honey (optional)</li>
        <li>Dashi (optional)</li>
        <li>Miso (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="direction">
        <li>Combine the sake and mirin in a pot, and bring to a boil. Then reduce to medium heat for about 20 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and soy sauce while maintaining heat. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>For more flavor add the desired addtives to taste. Feel free to experiment, although I recommend chicken bones, garlic, ginger and green onion.</li>
        <li>Once all additions are in the pot, maintain a light boil or simmer and reduce for 20 to 25 minutes. Until sauce is thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>Make sure to strain out any solids like onion and bones, before allowing to cool.</li>
        <em>Note: This can be cooled and saved for about a week to ten days. If using for yakitori or gyutori I recommend preparing in advance and storing in a
            fridge overnight.
